# House_Price_Prediction_ML_project
My task is to create a model which will predict the price for any new house by looking at the features such that no of rooms,industrial area,river bank,pollution rating,transport avalibility etc.While learning about Machine Learning ,it is best to actually work with real-world data ,not just artificial dataset and theoritical knowledge.By this project we have solved not only a practical problem but also a business model.
